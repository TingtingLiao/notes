Title: Curvature  
---
 

#- Principal Curvatures
How much the surface bends in different directions.

 

#- Gaussian Curvatures
$$k_G=k_1k_2$$

Gaussian curvature can be computed via a vertex's angular deficit:

$$k_G=2\pi - \sum_{j\in N(i)}\theta_{ij}$$

#- Mean Curvatures

$$H =(k_1+ k_2) / 2$$

the mean curvature can be computed via performing the Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to the surface positions.


$$-\triangle  x = Hn$$

#- Laplacian
Laplace operator is the divergence of the gradient, or equivalently the laplcaian of a function is the trace of its Hessian.
